Currently at [WHOOP](https://github.com/WhoopInc) doing R&D which means working in a lot of languages, wearing a lot of hats, and pretending I'm Doc Brown.

These days I'm mostly writing Python, SQL, TypeScript, and Kotlin. Before that it was a lot of Java and Kotlin and even before that it was a whole lot of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML with some C#, Ruby, and Python mixed in for good measure.
