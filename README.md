Currently at [WHOOP](https://github.com/WhoopInc) building internal tooling to improve hardware output and processes which means working in a lot of languages, wearing a lot of hats, and pretending I'm Doc Brown.

These days I'm mostly writing Python, SQL, TypeScript, Java, and Kotlin. Before that it was _a lot_ of Java and Kotlin and even before that it was _a whole lot_ of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML with some C# and Ruby mixed in for good measure.
